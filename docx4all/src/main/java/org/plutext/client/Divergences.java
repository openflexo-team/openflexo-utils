/* This class keeps track of the divergences between 
 * 2 document states.
 * 
 * Its primary purpose is to make it possible to 
 * adjust the position for inserts/moves.
 * 
 * One use is for applying server transforms.
 * 
 * In this case, you want to be able to make allowance
 * for any local insertions/
 * deletions which haven't yet been transmitted to 
 * the server, or if they have, have/will come back with
 * a sequence number which we haven't processed yet.
 * 
 * The other use is calculating positions to be
 * included in insert|move transforms to be 
 * transmitted to the server. (Each transform has
 * to be relative to the state the preceding transform
 * would produce).
 * 
 * The class is basically an ordered list of sdt id's,
 * each of which has associated with it an int:
 * 
 * -1 : this sdt not present (or deleted) on LHS
 *  0 : no change
 * +1 : this sdt inserted on LHS
 * 
 * (In the case of a move, there will be two entries,
 *  one with +1, and one with -1)
 * 
 * As updates are applied, we have to keep this object
 * up to date.  Insert transforms result in
 * new entries in the appropriate position, but their
 * associated int is *always 0*.  
 * 
 * If the thing being inserted is already present
 * (ie the transform insert is reflecting a change
 * local in origin), then the relevant int just changes
 * from 1 to 0.
 * 
 * Delete transforms result in the deletion of the appropriate entry.
